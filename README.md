# Los-Angeles-Crime-Data-Analysis
Abstract:
This project executes a comprehensive analysis of crime data within Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, concentrating on data sanitization, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualization. Utilizing Python and its associated data analysis libraries, the project aims to delineate crime trends, discern seasonal fluctuations, and assess the ramifications of significant societal events on crime occurrences. Through meticulous data cleansing and exploratory techniques, the study investigates correlations between crime manifestations and socio-economic variables, offering a detailed spatial and temporal crime distribution assessment.

Objectives:
To execute a rigorous cleaning and preparation process for the Los Angeles crime dataset. To deploy advanced visualization tools to unveil temporal and geographical crime trends. To dissect the influence of socio-economic elements and pivotal events on crime dynamics. To employ predictive modeling for future crime trend forecasting.

Data Source:
Utilizing publicly available data from the Los Angeles city government portal, this project analyses a comprehensive set of crime incident records starting from 2020, with meticulous attention paid to rectifying data anomalies such as missing values, duplicates, and statistical outliers.
